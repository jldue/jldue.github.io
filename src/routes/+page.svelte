Working with a small team, we created software components that integrated seamlessly with hardware elements like belts, motors, and sensors. I had the opportunity to work on all aspects of the machine's software, including embedded software for hardware control, machine learning for sex identification based on ultrasound images, system software (like the ultrasound interface) and desktop application for managing the entire system, and cloud software for AI training data collection and invoice processing. Our hard work led to the successful sale of several machines. As the company grew, I was appointed as the Chief Technology Officer of GreenFox Marine, guiding its continued growth and technological advancement."

    "From a young age, my fascination with computers was evident. When my father upgraded to a brand new Windows XP machine, I inherited his Windows 98 machine. However, before I could use it, he handed me a box of about 39 diskettes and instructed me to delete everything and install Windows from scratch. It was both a challenging and fun experience.",
    "Fast forward to university, I discovered a passion for programming alongside fellow students. My favorite project involved collaborating in groups to create a minimal version of an online shop as a web application. This project was unique because it required us to deliver a fully functional product to pass the class. While I appreciated the theoretical subjects for their importance in problem-solving, I thrived most when taking a product from concept to completion and making it useful for others.",
    "With the extensive experience gained from my recent full-time positions and the knowledge acquired through self-driven learning, I am now looking to advance my career. I am seeking technical leadership roles but am also open to individual projects as an independent contractor."
